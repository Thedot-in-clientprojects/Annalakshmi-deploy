            <h5  className="gilroyM">He mirrors the minds of those around him. Infinitely sensitive to every phenomenon and for whom every
            phenomenon is a stimulus capable of provoking an infinite series of thoughts, he is a man whom admirable texts
            cannot exhaust, do not even define. He says little, yet moves the young and old to action. An Indian by birth, 
            a Swami by choice, a Sadhu by temperament, his ideas are nurtured by the simple, universal truths repeated 
            endlessly in all cultures – serve, love, give – selflessly. Homeless in the literal sense of the word, yet firmly 
            entrenched in the hearts of those who seek answers to the eternal mysteries, he guides by the light of the 
            masters. He creates, outside the realm of reason, real yet symbolic worlds. His words confound and enlighten 
            simultaneously. They are, as all great words are, open to multitude of meanings. Together they form a myriad 
            of tiny mirrors that reflect the minds of his listeners. Perhaps the most striking quality of his thoughts is the way
            they dismantle beliefs and notions foisted by years of schooled wisdom and, at the end of it all to glimpse in a 
            strange intangible way, the quintessence of things as they always were and always will be. Such insights though
            rare and precious, are sufficient to inspire, to motivate action, to take that one extra step
            towards realizing a dream.</h5>

            <h5 className="gilroyM" style={{ marginBottom: "2rem"}}>The Temple of Fine Arts idea is based on a simple dictum – serve, love and give. It is an idea that has evolved
            into living palpable reality through an array of apparently disparate forms – a centre for the performing arts
            that seeks to refine above all else, a vegetarian restaurant that serves more than just delectable food, a travel 
            agency that places a premium on service rather than profit, and free medical and dental clinics that heal by 
            caring. Touching the self in a way that goodness and decency invariably surfaces, it promotes sensitivity to 
            one’s environment; a sense of harmony with fellow men. It teaches the value of faith in oneself and the 
            importance of Shradhdha or right effort. The result is a cooperative endeavour that allows one to give 
            according to his capacity and take according to his needs. It fosters continuity and change in a way that’s
            as bold as it is exciting. It moves away from the comfort of dogma by combining the traditional with the 
            modern. And it does it with an abandon that can only come from fearlessness, faith and fortitude. It is an 
            idea that works towards an ideal as it builds a future on the very best of the past.</h5>

            <h5 className="gilroyM" style={{ marginBottom: "2rem"}}>Music and dance form the principal offerings at The Temple. They are taught in the best traditions of the spirit
            behind the genres - a sublimation of the individual ego to the collective consciousness. Each performance is
            seen as a celebration, a brief transcendence through festival, when life is sanctified by ceremony. Taught by a 
            core of dedicated teachers, the classes serve to develop and refine the potential which each student brings
            to the Temple. While exceptional students are offered scholarships to pursue their calling, all students have 
            the opportunity to realize the extent of their dedication to their art by participating in the welter of activities
            that accompany each performance. The performances themselves have become legendary. Drawing their
            inspiration from stories as contemporary as Richard Bach’s Jonathan Livingston Seagull to epics as ancient
            as The Bhagavad Gita, they enthrall audiences through a unique synthesis of past and present; of traditional 
            movements and high-tech production techniques. The result is a visual feast of innovative choreography 
            flavoured by spectacular costumes, magnificent sets, evocative lights and memorable music. And it is all done
            for free for the love of Arts.</h5>
