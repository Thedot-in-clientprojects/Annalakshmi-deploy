            <h5  className="gilroyM">The foundation, strength and inspiration of Annalakshmi, is Swami Shantanand Saraswathi, who was born on 7th April 1934 as Chandrasekaran, in Thirukovillur, Tamil Nadu. Swamiji, as we endearingly call him, was initiated into divine Sanyas by Swami Sivananda, in 1951.

Swamiji was instrumental for the formation of dedicated institutions for numerous volunteers to practice Karma Yoga or Selfless Service. Annalakshmi, being one of these institutions, is where He allowed us to practice this infinite concept:

“Where we do service, not for financial gain, name or fame, but just to bring a little joy to our guests.”

We are grateful and delighted at the opportunity to serve you and thank you for your continued patronage and trust.</h5>

            <h5 className="gilroyM" style={{ marginBottom: "2rem"}}>The Temple of Fine Arts idea is based on a simple dictum – serve, love and give. It is an idea that has evolved
            into living palpable reality through an array of apparently disparate forms – a centre for the performing arts
            that seeks to refine above all else, a vegetarian restaurant that serves more than just delectable food, a travel 
            agency that places a premium on service rather than profit, and free medical and dental clinics that heal by 
            caring. Touching the self in a way that goodness and decency invariably surfaces, it promotes sensitivity to 
            one’s environment; a sense of harmony with fellow men. It teaches the value of faith in oneself and the 
            importance of Shradhdha or right effort. The result is a cooperative endeavour that allows one to give 
            according to his capacity and take according to his needs. It fosters continuity and change in a way that’s
            as bold as it is exciting. It moves away from the comfort of dogma by combining the traditional with the 
            modern. And it does it with an abandon that can only come from fearlessness, faith and fortitude. It is an 
            idea that works towards an ideal as it builds a future on the very best of the past.</h5>

            <h5 className="gilroyM" style={{ marginBottom: "2rem"}}>Music and dance form the principal offerings at The Temple. They are taught in the best traditions of the spirit
            behind the genres - a sublimation of the individual ego to the collective consciousness. Each performance is
            seen as a celebration, a brief transcendence through festival, when life is sanctified by ceremony. Taught by a 
            core of dedicated teachers, the classes serve to develop and refine the potential which each student brings
            to the Temple. While exceptional students are offered scholarships to pursue their calling, all students have 
            the opportunity to realize the extent of their dedication to their art by participating in the welter of activities
            that accompany each performance. The performances themselves have become legendary. Drawing their
            inspiration from stories as contemporary as Richard Bach’s Jonathan Livingston Seagull to epics as ancient
            as The Bhagavad Gita, they enthrall audiences through a unique synthesis of past and present; of traditional 
            movements and high-tech production techniques. The result is a visual feast of innovative choreography 
            flavoured by spectacular costumes, magnificent sets, evocative lights and memorable music. And it is all done
            for free for the love of Arts.</h5>

The founding of The Temple of Fine Arts in India in 1996
was a step, both into the past, as well as the future. Based on an
idea as old as Vedas, and yet contemporary in its appeal to the
young, it seeks to harness the energy of youth to preserve values
that are timeless. Voluntary, non-sectarian and liberal,
its growth over the years proves that the arts need not be mere thes
events to be enjoyed sensually but to serve as a vehicle for the
celebration of the spirit. If art expresses life and life is an
expression of the spirit, it follows that all art is spiritual
expressing he deepest impulses in man.<br/><br/>
The Temple of Fine Arts is thus more than a temple of
learning, it is an enclave of the past whose heritage and
traditions have sustained society, whose life-giving energy holds
out a promise for a better future.<br/><br/>
The Temple of Fine Arts is a cultural and service oriented
organization which has centers in Kuala Lampur, Penang
Malacca, Johor Bauru, Singapore, Chennai, Coimbatore
and Perth. Today, we are a well known organization in these
countries, recognized and respected as an institution whose
primary motive is that of service.
Our story is simply the story of a Guru who touched
hearts and lives of many, whose unconditional love for mankind
inspired us to serve, love and give.</h5>
